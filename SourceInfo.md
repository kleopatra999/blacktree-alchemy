This project contains the source to Quicksilver and (eventually) other related projects.

A few notes about the source trees:
  * Trunk contains the most recent version of the source. It it still _very_ experimental.
  * A B5X branch contains the most recent release versions, but it is only changed for critical issues. All major work happens on the trunk.
